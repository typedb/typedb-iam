# Now let's insert a new user and add them to the Cloud Team:

match
$g isa business-unit,
    has name "Cloud";
insert
$e isa employee,
    has full-name "Filip Inaros",
    has email "filip.inaros@vaticle.com";
(group: $g, member: $e) isa group-membership;

# Here we're doing a match-insert query. First we match the existing group Cloud, then we insert the new user and give
# him membership of the user group.
